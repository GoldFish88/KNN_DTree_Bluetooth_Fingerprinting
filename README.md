Date    : 11 June 2020

This project compares the performance of two classification algorithms in performing Bluetooth Fingerprinting. 

The code are divided into the following sections:
* Data Prepation
* Data Exploration
     * Propagation of Signal in Space
     * RSSI Readings on Grid Locations
     * Exploration in Time
     * Exploration of relationship of different variables
* Modelling
     * Feature Extraction
     * Grid Search (Parameter Tuning)
     * K-Folds Cross Validation
          * Using Raw RSSI
          * Using Moving Average RSSI
     * Effect of increasing the window size

This repository contains the following files:

**iBeacon_RSSI_Labeled.csv** The dataset used

**KNN_DTree_Bluetooth_Fingerprinting.ipynb** Contains the EDA and modelling codes
